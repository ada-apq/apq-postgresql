	Revision 1.0
	Obs.: The new Build-System are _in _construction process_. not all targets exist now.
	All options 'names' are in lowercase. Options 'values' are lowercase or is at your will ;-)
but remember , now days, most systems are 'case sensitive'
	And a prominente warning: how a _Developer_ don't use "spaces" in names et all ;-) _you_ will be 
more happy if you follow this advice. :-)
	Well, I opted by use "foe" in place of "eof" for minor clashes with shells and most names and values
are self descriptive. most times the "plural" names accept more que one value simultaneously 
and "singular" names accept just one value simultaneously.	
	And for now, while building "The Build System", It is 'fairly quiet' about successes 
and failures. but this is only for now :-). keep it in mind. :-)

1) makefile targets
1.1) configure
1.2) compile
1.3) install
1.4) clean
1.5) distclean
2) mixing all things ( example of real usage)

	A word about options(in all targets): Most times, 
and often, (if you follow sintatic rules [ eg: separator &cia]),
you _Can_ mix/add more que one value in option 'values' simultaneously. :-)


1.1) target configure
	command "make configure"

	Create directory "build",  and support files and directories.
	The effect is "acumulative" _and_ "cached/logged"  in per "individual" library basis; each time
you hit this command, it add and/or alter the correspondent files.

	Of course, is non-sense hit "make configure" without his options :-)
but if you do, it will take default values that don't can be what you want :-)
		
1.1.2) options for "configure" target

1.1.2.1) how choose System Operation(s)
1.1.2.1.2)	tag "oses="		separator ","
		eg: "make configure oses=linux "
		eg: "make configure oses=linux,bsd,mswindows "
		known values: all,linux,mswindows,darwin,bsd,other
		default value: linux

1.1.2.2) how choose what types of lib are for build
1.1.2.2.2)	tag "lib_build_types="	separator ","
		eg:	"make configure lib_build_types=static "
		eg:	"make configure lib_build_types=relocatable "
		eg: "make configure lib_build_types=dynamic "
or mix values at your will:-)
		eg: "make configure lib_build_types=static,relocatable,dynamic "
		known values: all,static,dynamic,relocatable
		default value: static,dynamic

1.1.2.3) how choose one(1) or more(2+) path(s) for search compilers ( and tools) when compiling
1.1.2.3.2)	tag "add_compiler_paths="	separator ":" or ";"
		eg:	"make configure add_compiler_paths=/usr/where/I/made/supercompiler/not_in/system_path_or/bring_to_front_in_path_search "
		eg:	"make configura add_compiler_paths=/usr/tools/bin:/home/dani/cross_compiling/bin:/usr/local/gnat-2012/bin:/etc "
		known values ? I will rely in you :-)
		default value: "none" (without double quotes)

1.1.2.4) how choose one(1) or more(2+) paths for search libs when building,compiling and linking
1.1.2.4.2)	tag "system_libs_paths="	separator ":" or ";"
			maximum of ten(10) paths _each time_ you hit this command. But it will "alter/substitute" old values
in "per lib"(a.k.a 'individual') basis. long as they are up to ten(10) values, the number of values in old or new values
doesn't matter. Enjoy! =]
		eg:	"make configure system_libs_paths=/usr/lib "
		eg	"make configure system_libs_paths=/usr/local/lib/gtkada/lib:/etc/local/lib:/etc/cross/mingw64/lib:/etc/bsd/lib:/etc/etc/lib
		all known values: Are you kidding me ? :-)
		default value: /usr/lib

1.1.2.5) how choose one(1) include path for openssl (or similar) 
		Always keep in mind this "motto target configure" ---> "_always_ in per lib_ basis_" =]
1.1.2.5.2)	tag "ssl_include_path=" separator ? don't exist :-)
		eg: "make configure ssl_include_path=/usr/lib/openssl "
		all Known values: I ( and we ) do not known :o]
		default value: /usr/lib/openssl

1.1.2.6) how choose one(1) _PATH_ on which is the binary of pg_config that "I Want"
1.1.2.6.2)	tag "pg_config_path="	separator ? don't exist =]
		eg:	"make configure pg_config_path=/usr/bin "
		known values: well... in Debian Sid, now days, is /usr/bin But I will rely in you to discover the correct value ;-)
		default value: /usr/bin

1.1.2.7) how choose one(1) _PATH_ on which is the binary of gprconfig that "I Want"
1.1.2.7.2)	tag "gprconfig_path="	separator ? don't exist =]
		eg:	"make configure gprconfig_path=/usr/bin "
		known values: I admit! I don't known... Because this I will rely in You Brave and Brighter Developer. Thank's :-)
		default value: /usr/bin

1.1.2.8) how choose one(1) _PATH_ on which is the binary of gprbuild that "I Want"
1.1.2.8.2)	tag "gprbuild_path="	separator ? don't exist =]
		eg:	"make configure gprbuild_path=/usr/bin "
